# HW1_code-refactor_AR
NW Bootcamp Homework Assignment 1
A webpage for a company called Horiseon.
This was a homework assignment for the Northwestern Coding Bootcamp where I recieved code and was required to refactor it.
I detailed each change I made in the HTML document. 
The main thing I did was add Alt tags to all images. However, I also got rid of some bits of code that has no effect on the webpage (i.e. unused ID's).
